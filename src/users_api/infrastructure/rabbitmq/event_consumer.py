"""Takes the events this service consumes off RabbitMQ.

The events exchange is shared; the dead letter exchange belongs to this service
so rejected messages stay isolated from the other consumers.

Delivery is at least once, so the handler has to tolerate a repeat. A message it
cannot make sense of goes to the dead letter queue, and one it could not handle
because something it depends on failed goes back to the queue.
