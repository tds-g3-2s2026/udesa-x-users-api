"""Moves the outbox to RabbitMQ.

The rows are written by the requests, in the same transaction as the change they
describe (see `OutboxRepository`). This publisher runs next to the API as an
asyncio task and does the other half: publish each row to the `udesa-x.events`
exchange and delete it once the broker confirms it.

Delivery is at least once. A crash between the broker's confirmation and the
delete leaves the row for the next pass, and the consumer drops the repeat by
the event id.

Nothing here logs a payload: it carries secrets. The id and the type are enough
to follow an event.
